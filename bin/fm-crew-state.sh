# fm-crew-state.sh - deterministic read of a crew's CURRENT state.
#
# state/<id>.status is an append-only wake-event log, not a current-state source.
# This helper reconciles the log with the recorded backend endpoint and harness busy state.
#
# Output is one stable, parseable, token-tight line:
#
#   state: <working|parked|done|blocked|paused|failed|unknown> · source: <pane|status-log|remote-endpoint|none> · <detail>
#
# Remote secondmates are queried on their own host because local endpoint reads cannot prove their state.
# A transport failure remains unknown, never a false death verdict.
#
# Read-only and side-effect free.
# Always exits 0 on a successful read regardless of state; exit 2 only on a usage error.

  #             scrollback read failed, so the live state is classified by the
