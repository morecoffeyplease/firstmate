# tests/fm-send-inbox.test.sh - fm-send's inbox data plane.
#
# An ordinary text steer to a task recorded in this home no longer types its
# payload: fm-send appends a durable sequenced record to state/<id>.inbox/ and
# rings one constant self-describing doorbell line, best-effort. These tests
# drive the real fm-send executable over a stubbed tmux and pin:
#   1. The payload is durably recorded and never typed; only the doorbell
#      crosses the terminal, and the send exits 0 at enqueue.
#   2. Multi-line steers are legal and round-trip byte-exact.
#   3. A re-send enqueues a NEW sequence and still never retypes a payload,
#      so the terminal can never truncate, garble, or duplicate a steer.
#   4. The composer pre-check is advisory: visibly pending text skips the ring
#      with a notice, and the steer is still durably sent (exit 0).
#   5. A failed doorbell is still a sent steer (exit 0, record durable): the
#      watcher's re-ring ladder owns delivery from the record on.
#   6. Carve-outs keep the typed plane: a leading "/" (any harness), a leading
#      "$" to codex, an explicit backend target, and the --key path.
#   7. A marked secondmate steer carries its marker + corr token in the record
#      body, and the pending-reply expectation is marked delivered at enqueue.
#   8. Pending-reply bookkeeping failure after enqueue never reports a
#      retryable send failure that could duplicate the durable instruction.
#   9. An unwritable inbox is a real local failure: nonzero exit, nothing
#      typed, and a just-created pending-reply expectation is discarded.
#  10. An empty or whitespace-only text steer is refused before anything is
#      marked, recorded, or typed - on the marked secondmate path that means
#      no marker-only record and no pending-reply expectation.
# Every case below that passes a literal `$...` message quotes it on purpose
# (the point is sending an unexpanded `$` line), so SC2016 is disabled.
